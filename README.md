For this project we looked at the Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore string searching algorithm and make a function that acts similarly to the CTRL + F function  on windows and the Command + F function of Mac. 
## How to compile
The code for this function is in the controlF.cpp file and the test cases are in the testCase file. 
```console
$ g++ -std=c++11 controlF.cpp -o search
```

```bash
$ ./seach test.txt "key"
```

The function will then ask which search algortihm to use for the searh
